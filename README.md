# Frontend Mentor - QR code component solution

## Overview

Hello!
This is my first project from the [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io).
I picked one of the simplest ones so I could get a basic idea of how does it look like.

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

In this project I learned the use of flexbox and it's properties.

```css
body{
    background-color: hsl(212, 45%, 89%) ;
    height: 100%;
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    font-family: 'Outfit', sans-serif;
}
```

That was also my first project where I started using HTML5 semantic website elements.

### Continued development

In future projects I would like to focus more on using flexbox and also I would like to learn a responsive web design.
