## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

For the first time I used flexbox.

```css
body{
    background-color: hsl(212, 45%, 89%) ;
    height:100%;
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    font-family: 'Outfit', sans-serif;
}
```

### Continued development

In future projects I would like to focus more on using flexbox and also I would like to learn a responsive web design.
